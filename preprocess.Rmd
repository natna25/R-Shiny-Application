Data preprocessing:

Show the aggregated values per year (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018) of
1 The total number of trains that have been carried out
2 The total number of delayed trains at departure
3 The total number of delayed trains at arrival
4 The average number of delayed trains at departure
5 The average number of delayed trains at arrival
6 The total average departure delay time of all trains
7 The total average arrival delay time of all trains
8 The average departure delay time of delayed trains
9 The average arrival delay time of delayed trains
10 The total number of cancelled trains
11 The percentage (proportion) of cancelled trains
12 The percentage (proportion) of delay causes



```{r}

Same aggregations but by train station instead

```{r}

#1-3
total_trains = aggregate(total_num_trips ~ departure_station, trains, sum) 
total_depart_delays = aggregate(num_late_at_departure ~ departure_station, trains, sum)
total_arrival_delays = aggregate(num_arriving_late ~ departure_station, trains, sum)

#3-4
avg_depart_delays = aggregate(num_late_at_departure ~ departure_station, trains, mean)
avg_arrival_delays = aggregate(num_arriving_late ~ departure_station, trains, mean)

#6-7
total_avg_depart_delay = aggregate(avg_delay_late_on_arrival ~ departure_station, trains, sum)
total_avg_arrival_delay = aggregate(avg_delay_late_at_departure ~ departure_station, trains, sum)

#8-9
avg_depart_delay = aggregate(avg_delay_late_on_arrival ~ departure_station, trains, mean)
avg_arrival_delay = aggregate(avg_delay_late_at_departure ~ departure_station, trains, mean)

#10-11
total_train_cancelled = aggregate(num_of_canceled_trains ~ departure_station, trains, sum)

# preprocessing of flights data

next, we move onto the flights dataset which contains quite a bit of data


```{r}

flights = read_csv("data/raw/flights.csv")
airlines = read_csv("data/raw/airlines.csv")
airports = read_csv("data/raw/airports.csv")


print(head(flights))
print(head(airlines))
print(head(airports))
```

## aggregations by airline
1) The total number of flights
2) The total number of delayed flights
3) The average flight duration
4) The average flight distance
5) The total distance covered by all airline flights
6) The average departure delay
7) The average arrival delay


```{r}

total_flights = flights %>% group_by(AIRLINE) %>% tally(name="flight_count")
total_delayed_flights = flights %>% group_by(AIRLINE) %>% filter(DEPARTURE_DELAY > 0) %>% tally(name="delay_count")
avg_flight_time = flights %>% group_by(AIRLINE) %>% summarise( mean = mean(ELAPSED_TIME))

avg_flight_time

```
